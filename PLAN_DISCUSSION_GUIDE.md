### 3. **What the AI Coach Can Help With**

- **Plan Explanation**: Understand why specific recommendations were made
- **Concern Resolution**: Address time constraints, difficulty levels, or preferences
- **Customization**: Modify activities, timing, or intensity based on your lifestyle
- **Alternative Options**: Suggest different approaches if the original plan doesn't fit
- **Motivation**: Provide encouragement and build confidence in your plan
